        <h1>Pets and the Pandemic</h1>
        <h2>Minh Nguyen</h2>
    
        A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many Australians took the opportunity to 
        introduce a pet into their household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a 
        significant increase in the percent of households taking in <em>a new dog, fish or bird</em>. Their research 
        also indicated that pets had a number of <strong>positive influences</strong> on their lives such as:
        <ul>
        <li>Companionship</li>
        <li>Better mental health</li>
        <li>Joy and happiness.</li>
        </ul>
